# Jinja2:
###############
Jinja2 is a powerful and flexible template engine based on Python.
It is widely used in Ansible to create dynamic configuration files, scripts or other text-based outputs.
It integrates with YAML-based Ansible playbooks and provides features such as variables, loops, conditions and filters.
Ansible uses Jinja2 specifically with the template module.
This module processes Jinja2 template files (.j2 extension) and generates dynamic configuration files on target machines.
Additionally, Jinja2 expressions such as variables and loops can be used directly in playbooks.
