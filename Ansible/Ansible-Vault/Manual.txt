# Ansible Vault:
####################

Ansible Vault encrypts sensitive data during configuration management. (API keys, passwords, private keys, username/password)
Ansible Vault uses the AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard 256-bit) encryption algorithm.

-Database passwords
-SSH keys
-API tokens
-LDAP credentials
-Cloud provider access credentials (AWS, Azure, etc.)

#File Encryption:
ansible-vault encrypt existing.yml  # Encrypt existing file
ansible-vault encrypt existing.yml file1.yml file2.yml file3.yml # Encrypt Multi existing files
ansible-vault create secret.yml  # Create new encrypted file

#Other Actions:
ansible-vault view secret.yml  # View encrypted file
ansible-vault edit secret.yml  # Edit the encrypted file
ansible-vault rekey secrets.yml # Change Ansible Vault Password
ansible-vault decrypt secret.yml  # Remove encryption

#Working with Encrypted Files:
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass  # Run with password
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --vault-password-file=password.txt  # Run with password file

#Security Warnings:
-Add the file where you store the vault password to .gitignore. This way, this file will not be included in source control systems such as git.
-Make file permissions "600"
-Use different vault passwords for production environments
-If the vault password is forgotten, it cannot be recovered, make a backup plan.
