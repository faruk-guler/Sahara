# Ansible Roles:
####################
Ansible Roles are structures used to organize tasks and configurations in a modular way, providing reusable and configurable components.
An Ansible Role has a defined directory structure with eight(8) main standard directories.
Roles allow specific tasks to be organized within a playbook. The directory where the roles are located is usually located in roles/

cd ~/roles/
<role_name>/
  ├── defaults/  # default variables for the role.
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── files/ # contains files which can be deployed via this role.
  ├── handlers/  # contains handlers, which may be used by this role or outside of this role.
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── meta/  # defines some meta data for this role.
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── tasks/  # contains the main list of tasks to be executed by the role.
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── templates/  # contains templates which can be deployed via this role.
  ├── vars/  # other variables for the role.
  |   └── main.yml
  ├──  tests  # contains tests for the role.

> Sample playbook to use the role:
---
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - role_name

ansible-galaxy role init <role_name> # Creates new role skeleton
ansible-galaxy role remove <role_name> # Deletes the role
ansible-galaxy install <role_name> # Installs the role
ansible-galaxy list # Lists installed roles
